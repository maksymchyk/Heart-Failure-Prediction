Heart-Failure-Prediction

Using the dataset for heart disease and ECG parameters that can help predict it, we are going to analyze relations between each parameter and the heart failure risk to develop a risk assessment model for a life insurance company. This will allow the company to request ECG results from potential clients in the risk zone and analyze them to calculate the risk. The risk rating in turn will aloow the company to include it in their pricing model, and provide more accurate and better suited quotes for individual clients.
